# Printing PDF'S and Images Xamarin Forms Sample
Recently I had the need to implement a Printing feature for one of my Xamarin Forms projects, and discovered it was actually kind of straight forward to do, which brings me to our article of this week!

Right now Xamarin Forms does not support printing out of the box, but the good news is that each native platform already has support for this feature and we just need to tap into each native library and expose this feature for our App.

This repo is for the sample project of the [Printing PDF'S and Images Xamarin.Forms](https://www.pujolsluis.com/printing-pdfs-and-images-xamarin-forms/)
